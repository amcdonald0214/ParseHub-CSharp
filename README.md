## Synopsis

ParseHub (www.parsehub.com) is a great tool for web scraping. They also provide a robust API for interacting with your ParseHub projects and operations. ParseHub-CSharp is the unofficial C# client for working with the ParseHub API.

## Capabilities

Currently, the ParseHub-CSharp client supports:
- Getting all ParseHub projects in your account
- Getting a specific ParseHub project
- Starting a Run of a project
- Getting a Run and the associated data returned by the run

## Motivation

You can do a lot with ParseHub, but there was no C# client for their API at the time this was created.

## Prerequisites

An API key from a free or paid ParseHub account

## Contributors

The ParseHub API has other capabilities that have not yet been implemented here in the C# client. Feel free to jump in and help add to this project.
